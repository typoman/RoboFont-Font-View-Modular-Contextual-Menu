# RoboFont Fontview Menu
A modular contextual menu for the font overview in RoboFont. This extension reads a folder of scripts
and creates the menu items based on the scripts and folder structure. By defualt this extension uses 
the same folder as the `Scripts` menu items (which is the defualt script folder of RoboFont). 
You can change this folder and use another folder which only has sepecific scripts for the contextual 
menu in the font overview.

# Usage
Right click on any glyph inside the font overview.

# Changing the script folder
Choose the menu item `Extensions > Font View Menu > Set Script Folder`.
